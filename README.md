# Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

# What do I need to install?
I will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

# What will I learn?
After completing the project, I will:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

# Project details 

## Step One - Choose the data
I chose four datasets from Gapminder.
- Female salaried employee
- Female literacy rate
- Gdp per capita
- Life expectancy at birth

## Step two - Get Organized
Create a single folder (repositories) that contains:
- The report communicating your findings
- Any Python code you wrote as part of your analysis
- The data set you used

## Step three - Analyse the data
Make questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables. I aimed to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables in my investigation. Make sure I use NumPy and pandas where they are appropriate!

## Step four - Share your findings
Create a report that shares the findings I found most interesting.
